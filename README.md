## Key Learnings

Through the development of this web application, I gained experience and improved my skills in the following areas:

- **Web Application Planning**: I outlined the site structure with a page map and built wireframes for each major section, focusing on usability.
- **HTML & CSS Development**: I enhanced my skills in creating well-structured markup and visually consistent pages using CSS.
- **JavaScript for Interactivity**: I implemented interactive components such as a modal, tooltips, and dynamic content updates based on user input.
- **API Integration**: I used two different APIs â€” one to retrieve external data (via the Fetch API), and one to send email submissions from the quote request form.
- **UX Feedback and Iteration**: I improved the design and interactivity based on user testing and feedback from peers.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts to various screen sizes for both desktop and mobile users.
- **Interactive Components**:
  - Modal popup for quote confirmation
  - Tooltips guiding form input
  - Image switching via dropdown in the "Recent Work" page
  - Accordion UI in the About page
- **Email Submission**: The quote form sends an email directly to the business using an external email API.

## Technologies Used

- **CSS**: For layout, styling, and transitions.
